# P0 Multi-Symbol Scanner Implementation - COMPLETE 🎉

## Summary
Successfully implemented P0 phase of the multi-symbol scanner system with priority-based trading and hysteresis switching.

## ✅ Completed Features (P0)

### P0.1 - Configuration System
- **File:** `config.yaml`
- **Added:** Complete scanner section with all required parameters
- **Key Settings:**
  - `watchlist_top_n: 20` - Top symbols to monitor
  - `refresh_sec: 30` - Scanner refresh interval
  - `lead_margin: 0.15` - Hysteresis threshold (15%)
  - `lock_min_sec: 300` - Minimum time before switch (5 min)
  - `cooldown_after_close_sec: 60` - Cooldown after position close

### P0.2 - Scanner Core Logic
- **File:** `scanner/candidates.py`
- **Components:**
  - `CandidateScore` dataclass with all metrics
  - `compute_priority()` - P = Vol + Flow + Info - Cost
  - `pick_active()` - Hysteresis-based symbol selection
  - `build_watchlist()` - CCXT-based top volume discovery
  - `subscribe_watchlist()` - WS subscription management
  - `log_scanner_data()` - CSV logging system

### P0.3 - Multi-Symbol Runner
- **File:** `backtest/runner.py`
- **Features:**
  - `MultiSymbolRunner` class with scan→pick→trade loop
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - WS subscription management
  - Symbol switching orchestration
  - Top-5 candidate logging

### P0.4 - Integration Hooks
- **File:** `backtest/sim_loop.py`
- **Added:**
  - `on_symbol_switch()` - Position closing and cache cleanup
  - `log_scanner_data()` - Individual scan logging
  - CSV import for logging functionality

### P0.5 - Logging System
- **Files:** 
  - `logs/scanner.csv` - Per-scan symbol data
  - Scanner data includes: timestamp, symbol, priority, vol/flow/info/cost scores, selected flag, reason
- **Integration:** Complete logging in both candidates.py and sim_loop.py

## 📊 Enhanced Configuration

### Relaxed Trading Filters
- `max_spread_bps: 15` (was 6) - Allow wider spreads for more opportunities
- Long threshold: 65 (was 70) - Easier long entry
- Short threshold: 35 (was 30) - Easier short entry
- **Result:** Should generate more real trades vs TEST entries

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Scanner System Flow:
1. Build Watchlist (top 20 by volume)
2. Subscribe to WS feeds for all symbols
3. Compute priority scores every 30s
4. Apply hysteresis switching logic
5. Switch symbols if better candidate found
6. Close positions during switches
7. Log all scanning data to CSV
```

### Priority Formula
```
Priority = Vol_Score + Flow_Score + Info_Score - Cost_Score
- Vol: 24h volume percentile (0-100)
- Flow: Order flow imbalance strength (0-100)  
- Info: News/social sentiment impact (0-100)
- Cost: Spread + slippage penalty (0-100)
```

### Hysteresis Logic
```
Switch conditions:
- New candidate priority > current * (1 + lead_margin)
- Minimum lock time elapsed (5 min)
- Not in cooldown period (1 min after close)
```

## 🔧 Demo & Testing

### Demo Script
- **File:** `run_multi_symbol.py`
- **Features:**
  - 5-minute demo runtime
  - Real-time scanning every 30s
  - Symbol switching visualization
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### Test Command
```bash
python run_multi_symbol.py
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### Quality vs Quantity Tradeoffs
- **Relaxed Filters:** More trades but potentially lower win rate
- **Multi-Symbol:** Better opportunity selection, higher fill rates
- **Hysteresis:** Reduced whipsawing, more stable selections

### Performance Metrics to Monitor
- Trades per hour (should increase significantly)
- Average spread paid (may increase slightly)
- Win rate (may decrease slightly but volume should compensate)
- Scanner switching frequency (should be ~2-4 times per hour)

## 🔄 Next Phase: P1 Implementation

### P1.1 - Per-Symbol Model Calibration
- Individual risk/size models per symbol
- Symbol-specific feature engineering

### P1.2 - WebSocket Reliability 
- Connection monitoring and alerts
- Automated failover mechanisms

### P1.3 - Scanner Dashboard
- Real-time priority visualization
- Historical switching analysis
- Performance metrics tracking

## 🚀 Ready for Live Testing

The P0 multi-symbol scanner system is now complete and ready for simulation testing. The relaxed filters combined with intelligent symbol selection should provide significantly more trading opportunities while maintaining systematic risk management.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Automated symbol discovery and switching
- ✅ Priority-based opportunity selection  
- ✅ Hysteresis prevents excessive switching
- ✅ Complete logging for analysis
- ✅ Graceful position management during switches
- ✅ Configurable parameters for fine-tuning

**Usage:** Run `python run_multi_symbol.py` to test the complete system.
